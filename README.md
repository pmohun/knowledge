## What is this?

I spend a lot of time online. This wiki is a way for me to catalog the things that I find and organize my notes and writings. 

## How does it work?

All of the information is hosted on my [Github](https://github.com/pmohun) and written in Markdown. Content is organized into topics, and contains raw notes, links to projects, and references. Although the wiki is mostly for personal use, I try to write my notes in a way that makes them accessible for anyone.
