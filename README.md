description: Welcome to my wiki. This is a compilation of everything that I know.

# Start here!

## What is this?

I spend a lot of time online. This wiki is a way for me to catalog the things that I find and organize my notes and writings. 

## How does it work?

All of the information is hosted on my [Github](https://github.com/pmohun) and written in Markdown. Content is organized into topics, and contains raw notes, links to projects, and references. Although the wiki is mostly for personal use, I try to write my notes in a way that makes them accessible for anyone. 

## How do I use it?

Feel free to start with the sidebar and poke around for topics you find interesting. You can also use the search bar for keywords. 

## Get in touch.

You can provide comments by editing this repository [on Github](https://github.com/pmohun/knowledge/blob/master/README.md). 

If you want to reach out directly, you can reach me at philmohun \(at\) gmail.com

I also write blogs [on Medium](https://medium.com/@philmohun/latest), short stories [on my website](https://philmohun.com), publish a [weekly newsletter](https://philmohun.substack.com), and think aloud [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/philmohun).
