_We don't get to choose what happens to us, but we can always choose how we feel about it. And why on earth would you choose to feel anything but good?_

## Benjamin Franklin

_Great affairs sometimes take their rise from small circumstances._

## Herman Melville

_Call me Ishmael. Some years ago - never mind how long precisely - having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen, and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's hats off - then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship._

## Seneca

_It is a rough road that leads to the heights of greatness._ 

_What man can you show me who places any value on his time, who reckons the worth of each day, who understands that he is dying daily? For we are mistaken when we look forward to death; the major portion of death has already passed, Whatever years be behind us are in death's hands._

_We suffer more often in imagination than in reality._

_Alone. Yes, thats the key word, the most awful word in the English tongue. Murder doesn't hold a candle to it and hell is only a poor synonym._

_The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed._

## Frank Herbert

_Your habits always come hunting after you. The self you construct will haunt you_

_And the price we paid was the price men have always paid for achieving a paradise in this life — we went soft, we lost our edge._

_Hope clouds observation._

_It is so shocking to find out how many people do not believe that they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult._

_To stay awake all night adds a day to your life._

_Parting with friends is a sadness. A place is only a place._

_Show me a completely smooth operation and I’ll show you someone who’s covering mistakes. Real boats rock._

_And always, he fought the temptation to choose a clear, safe course, warning "That path leads ever down into stagnation."_

_Good government never depends upon laws, but upon the personal qualities of those who govern._

_Laws to suppress tend to strengthen what they would prohibit._

## Vladamir Zworykin

_One cannot stumble on an idea unless one is running._ 

## Alan Watts

_I have realized that the past and future are real illusions, that they exist in the present, which is what there is and all there is._

## Kurt Vonnegut

_Later on in life, the Tralfamadorians would advise Billy to concentrate on the happy moments of his life, and to ignore the unhappy ones -- to stare only at pretty things as eternity failed to go by._ 

## William Shakespeare

_There is a tide in the affairs of men. Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune; Omitted, all the voyage of their life Is bound in shallows and in miseries. On such a full sea are we now afloat, And we must take the current when it serves, Or lose our ventures._
